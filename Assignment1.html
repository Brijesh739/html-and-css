	<h2>History:</h2><br>
	<p>To 95% of people in the world, when the term Pizza is heard, their mind goes to Italy, coz why not? Just kidding. Pizza was invented in Italy, in the eighteenth century by a man named Raffaele Esposito who was from Naples. Though he is credited for inventing the pizza, historians note that many roadsidde vendors sold just bread with some vegetables and sauces cooked together. This was not exactly a pizza, but could have been the base throough which Raffaele got inspiration to cook the world's very first Pizza. </p>
