	<h2>History:</h2><br>
	<p><span style="font-family: Rowdies; font-size: 1.5em; color: black; ">T</span>o 95% of people in the world, when the term Pizza is heard, their mind goes to Italy, coz why not? Just kidding. Pizza was invented in Italy, in the eighteenth century by a man named <b>Raffaele Esposito</b> who was from <i>Naples</i>. Though he is credited for inventing the pizza, historians note that many roadsidde vendors sold just bread with some vegetables and sauces cooked together. This was not exactly a pizza, but could have been the base through which Raffaele got inspiration to cook the world's very first Pizza. </p>
	<h2>Pizza in our day-to-day lives.</h2>
	<br>
	<p><span style="font-family: Rowdies; font-size: 1.5em; color: black; ">T</span>he pizza is easily the most consumed fast food in the world. It is very highly consumed in Europe and the Americas. It is very taste satisfying but not that healthy, so we shouldn't eat in exccess ðŸ˜€.</p> <p>It is a great thing to eat and can be used as main course in many parties. It goes well with anything, be it paneer or corn.</p>
